JavaScript-Runtime-OpcodeCounting
=================================

This module provides an extended JavaScript::Runtime class that keeps track on how many opcodes 
are executed by the runtime. It can also be set to abort execution when N number of opcodes have
been executed by setting an upper limit.

Currently both the counter and the limit are implemented as U32 values. If lots, and I mean *lots*, 
of opcodes are executed without resetting the counter it will eventually overflow.
